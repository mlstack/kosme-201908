    "They run on one month (30 days) cycles, we have one cycle to show we can provide value.\n",

    "There is one robot, 2 engineers and one detailer in the factory. The detailer has some holiday off, so only has 21 days available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2 cars need different time with each resource:\n",
    "\n",
    "Robot time: Car A – 3 days; Car B – 4 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Engineer time: Car A – 5 days; Car B – 6 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailer time: Car A – 1.5 days; Car B – 3 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Car A provides €30,000 profit, whilst Car B offers €45,000 profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment, they produce 4 of each cars per month, for €300,000 profit. Not bad at all, but we think we can do better for them.\n",
